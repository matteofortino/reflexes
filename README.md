# Reflexes

Reflexes is a simple game written in vanilla javascript that allows two players to see which of them has better reflexes.

Once the player presses the start button a box will turn red after a random time, this game then calculates how many milliseconds it took the player to click on this box after it became red, and logs the reaction time on the page.
The second player does the same and whoever was faster, wins!
